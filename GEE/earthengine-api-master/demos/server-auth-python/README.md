# Earth Engine Demo: Server-Side Authentication in Python

[Live Demo](https://server-auth-python-dot-ee-demos.appspot.com/)

This example shows how to build a simple Google App Engine web application that
communicates with Google Earth Engine.  Upon successful deployment, you will see
a webpage with a Google map showing the SRTM DEM zoomed into the east coast of
Australia.

To set the app up yourself, download the Earth Engine API repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/google/earthengine-api.git
```

Navigate to the Server Auth example code:

```
cd ./earthengine-api/demos/server-auth-python
```

Then follow the instructions in the Developer Docs to
[deploy an EE-based App Engine app](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/app_engine_intro#deploying-app-engine-apps-with-earth-engine).
For the credentials section, you'll need a Service Account, not an OAuth2 Client
ID. Next:

1.  Move the Service Account private key (`privatekey.json`) into the
    `demos/server-auth-python` folder.
2.  [Create an API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
    and include it in `index.html` to load Google Maps API.
3.  Copy `javascript/build/ee_api_js.js` into
    `demos/server-auth-python/static/`.
